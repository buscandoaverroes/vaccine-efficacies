# vaccine-efficacies
Visualizes vaccine efficacy rates from clinical trial data.

## The Issue
What is does a vaccine's "efficacy rate" mean in practicality? The medical community often reports final data in "odds-ratios", which make empirical sense, but may be difficult for the average non-scientist to interpret.

In my intermediate Statistics course in school, my professor presented us with this very conundrum -- and this repo is a sandbox to see if I can construct a visualization that presents vaccines efficacy rates in a slightly more intiuite way.
