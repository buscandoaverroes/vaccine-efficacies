### Takeaways

1.  Your protection chances from Covid are much higher than the stated
    efficacy
2.  Vaccines work. While clinical data showed that a few participants in
    vaccine group did catch the virus, all approved COVID-19 vaccines
    drastically reduce the average person's chances of contracting the
    virus.
3.  Differences in efficacy rates between vaccines don't matter much in
    practicality -- it's more important just to get vaccinated.

### Keep in Mind

The clinical trials occurred in different places and stages of the
pandemic, so they aren't perfectly comparable. Also, these studies
revealed slightly different efficacies based on demographic factors like
age (see About tab for study links). Finally, if you're vaccinated, it's
very important to continue following CDC guidelines on masking and
social distancing to protect those still waiting for a vaccine.
