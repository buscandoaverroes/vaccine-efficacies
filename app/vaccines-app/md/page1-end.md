### Takeaways

1.  Mathematically, an average person's protection chances from Covid are higher than the stated efficacy.
2.  Vaccines work. All approved COVID-19 vaccines drastically reduce the average person's chances of contracting the virus.
3.  Differences in efficacy rates between vaccines don't matter much in practicality -- it's more important just to get vaccinated.

### Keep in Mind

The clinical trials occurred in different places and stages of the pandemic, so they aren't perfectly comparable. Also, these studies revealed slightly different efficacies based on demographic factors like age. Finally, if you're vaccinated, it's very important to continue following CDC guidelines on masking and social distancing to protect those still waiting for a vaccine.

### Still have Questions?

For general information on Covid-19 and vaccines, visit the CDC or consult your physician. The [Pfizer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7745181/) and [Moderna](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787219/) papers contain detailed and accessible information on the clinical trials themselves. Finally, my About page has a few in-progress notes about the project.
