### Takeaways

1.  The average person's chances of being protected from covid are higher than the efficacy.
2.  Vaccines work. All approved COVID-19 vaccines drastically reduce the average person's chances of contracting the virus.
3.  If you're concerned about staying protected from covid, mathematically, the biggest difference you can make is just to get vaccinated. Variations in vaccine efficacies aren't as important as simply getting vaccinated.

### Keep in Mind

Regardless of vaccination status, it's very important to continue to follow CDC guidelines on masking and social distancing to protect those still waiting for a vaccine. Also, the clinical trials occurred in different places and stages of the pandemic, so they aren't perfectly comparable.

### Still have Questions?

I encourage you to go to the [CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html) on Covid-19 with general questions, or contact your physican. You can also take a look at the [Pfizer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7745181/) and [Moderna](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787219/) papers themselves if you're curious. Finally, my About and Q+A pages have a few in-progress notes about the project.
