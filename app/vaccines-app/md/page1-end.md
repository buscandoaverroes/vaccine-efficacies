### Takeaways

1.  Mathematically, one's protection chances from Covid are higher than the stated efficacy.
2.  Vaccines work. While clinical data showed that a few participants in vaccine group did catch covid, all approved COVID-19 vaccines drastically reduce the average person's chances of contracting the virus.
3.  Differences in efficacy rates between vaccines don't matter much in practicality -- it's more important just to get vaccinated.

### Keep in Mind

The clinical trials occurred in different places and stages of the pandemic, so they aren't perfectly comparable. Also, these studies revealed slightly different efficacies based on demographic factors like age (see About tab for study links). Finally, if you're vaccinated, it's very important to continue following CDC guidelines on masking and social distancing to protect those still waiting for a vaccine.

#### Wait, so why are protection chances slightly better with Moderna even though Pfizer has a higher efficacy rate?

Again, math. Because in the Pfizer clinical trials, the data showed a higher "baseline" population infection rate in the placebo group compared to the data in the Moderna trials. Essentially, the Pfizer data measured a greater risk of catching covid. Since chances of protection depend on both baseline risk and efficacy rate, the figure happens to end up ever so slightly more favorable based on Moderna's data. It should be noted that these differences are so minor and based on assumptions and averages that are unlikely to hold *exactly* how they did in clinical trials for every person. The takeaway is that both vaccines leave the average person with extremely good chances of protection from covid.

### Still have Questions?

I encourage you to take a look at the [Pfizer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7745181/) and [Moderna](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787219/) papers themselves if you're curious. Also, my About page has a few in-progress notes about the project.
