### Takeaways

1.  Mathematically, one's protection chances from Covid are higher than the stated efficacy.
2.  Vaccines work. All approved COVID-19 vaccines drastically reduce the average person's chances of contracting the virus.
3.  Differences in efficacy rates between vaccines don't matter much in practicality -- it's more important just to get vaccinated.

### Keep in Mind

The clinical trials occurred in different places and stages of the pandemic, so they aren't perfectly comparable. Also, these studies revealed slightly different efficacies based on demographic factors like age. Finally, if you're vaccinated, it's very important to continue following CDC guidelines on masking and social distancing to protect those still waiting for a vaccine.

#### Why are protection chances better with Moderna even though Pfizer has a higher efficacy rate?

Math! Because protection chances are a depend on both efficacy rate and baseline risk of getting covid. The Pfizer clinical trials showed a higher "baseline" population infection rate in the placebo group compared to the data in the Moderna trials. Essentially, the Pfizer data measured a greater risk of catching covid, and this makes up for the difference in a higher efficacy rate.

These differences are so minor and the conditions in the clinical trials are unlikely to hold *exactly* every person in eternity. The takeaway is that both vaccines leave the average person with extremely good chances of protection from covid across a range of scenarios.

I encourage you to take a look at the [Pfizer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7745181/) and [Moderna](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787219/) papers themselves if you're curious. Also, my About page has a few in-progress notes about the project.
