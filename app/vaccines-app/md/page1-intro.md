# Covid-19 Vaccine Calculator

Your chance of protection is not the efficacy rate -- calculate them both and explore clinical data.

### The Calculator

As Covid-19 vaccination efforts continue around the globe, [many questions remain](https://www.was+/hingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/01/vaccinated-people-precautions/) about what vaccination means for those inoculated in practicality (WaPost, 02/01). Also, discrepancies in efficacy rates of available vaccines could shape individual preferences or even broader trends in public uptake. However, contrary to very sensible intuition, one's expected chance of protection from covid is *not* the vaccine efficacy rate.

It's just math! Once you're fully vaccinated, your chances of protection depend on:

-   the vaccine efficacy rate
-   how prevalent the virus is in the general population
-   other individual risk factors
